[LuaHPDF](http://luahpdf.colloquiki.com/) is a module that lets you programmatically create PDF files using [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). It does this by binding to the [Haru Free PDF Library](https://github.com/tony2001/libharu), an open-source library that manages the details of PDF generation.

With this module, you can write Lua programs that will produce PDF files that include

  * lines, text and graphics
  * PNG and JPEG images
  * compression
  * encryption
  * Type1 and TrueType fonts
  * various character sets
  * outlines
  * links

This module works on POSIX and Windows platforms.
